Using the diabetes.csv dataset provided by Kaggle and the libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scipy to analyse the data encased in the csv file. 
Aim to create a simple machine learning model with the findings that can predict with good likelihood whether a patient (restricted to females over the age of 21 and of Pima Indian heritage) has diabetes or not.
